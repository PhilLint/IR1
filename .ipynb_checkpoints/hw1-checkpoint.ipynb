The 'theory' questions in this assignment serve as a preparation for the exam and to facilitate a deeper understanding of the course content. These questions (denoted by `TODO: Answer this!`) have no points assigned to them, but **need** to be filled out before submission.  \n",

This technique, called trace-driven modeling, provides an accurate replica of a production environment for the testing of variations in the system.  At the same time alterations in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in a controlled way with cause and effects relationships being isolated.  The scheduling methods tested included the best possible and worst possible methods, the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory, round-robin, first-come-first-served, etc., and dynamic predictors.
